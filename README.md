## Feature Ideas & Constraints

This section documents potential features or tasks that could significantly enhance the app but were unable to be implemented due to time constraints. These are ideas or improvements that the development team would consider adding in the future, based on time, resources, or priority.

### Potential Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
A more detailed dashboard for tracking user progress, displaying data visualizations like graphs for streaks, and completed habits over time.

- **Social Sharing**  
The ability to share achievements and completed habits on social media. Users could share a post or badge showing off their progress, increasing visibility and encouraging engagement.

- **Customizable Notifications**  
Let users set personalized reminders and notifications for specific habits, including options for push notifications, in-app reminders, or emails.

- **Habit History & Trends**  
A history feature that shows trends in the user’s habit data, such as how often certain habits were completed over time. It would allow users to reflect on their consistency and identify patterns in their behavior.

- **Engaging Animations**  
Enhance the user experience with more engaging and dynamic animations, such as the 3D rotation effect on achievement badges, similar to Apple Fitness.

### Constraints

- **Limited Time for Implementation**  
  Due to limited time, only core features (like tracking completed habits and achievement system) were prioritized. More advanced features, such as personalized progress tracking, could not be implemented within the current project timeline.

- **User Customization**  
  Customizing habit categories or personalizing the look and feel of the app is an idea for future improvements. However, this would require extra development resources and time that were unavailable in the current scope.
