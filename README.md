### Screenshots
Below are some screenshots showcasing the key features of TrackIt:

### Home Screen
This is where you can view your daily habits and mark them as complete. You can also create (by **tapping on the + button**), edit, and delete habits (by **sliding each habit to the left**).

|  |  |
|-------|------|
| ![home_page](assets/images/home_page_framed_bigger.png) | **Heatmap**: The Heatmap visualizes your progress over time. It uses a color gradient to show how many habits you have completed each day. The darker the color, the more habits you have completed. <br><br> **Streaks**: Your Streaks are tracked to motivate you. Every day you complete a habit, your streak increases. |
| ![achievement_unlock](assets/images/achievement_unlocked.png) | **Achievement Unlocked**: As you continue to track and complete your habits, you will unlock various achievements. |

### Profile Screen
This is where you can see your achievements and progress in one place. It gives you a high-level overview of your journey and rewards you for consistency.

| ![profile_page](assets/images/profile_page_framed.png) | **Achievements**: On the **Profile Screen**, you can view the achievements you have unlocked. These achievements act as badges that showcase your progress and dedication in building habits. <br><br> For instance: <br><br> **First Habit:** Awarded for completing your first habit. <br><br> **Streak Master:** Awarded for reaching a streak of 7 days. <br><br> **Completionist:** Awarded after completing 100 habits. |

## Feature Ideas & Constraints

This section documents potential features or tasks that could significantly enhance the app but were unable to be implemented due to time constraints. These are ideas or improvements that the development team would consider adding in the future, based on time, resources, or priority.

### Potential Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
A more detailed dashboard for tracking user progress, displaying data visualizations like graphs for streaks, and completed habits over time.

- **Social Sharing**  
The ability to share achievements and completed habits on social media. Users could share a post or badge showing off their progress, increasing visibility and encouraging engagement.

- **Customizable Notifications**  
Let users set personalized reminders and notifications for specific habits, including options for push notifications, in-app reminders, or emails.

- **Habit History & Trends**  
A history feature that shows trends in the user‚Äôs habit data, such as how often certain habits were completed over time. It would allow users to reflect on their consistency and identify patterns in their behavior.

- **Engaging Animations**  
Enhance the user experience with more engaging and dynamic animations, such as the 3D rotation effect on achievement badges, similar to Apple Fitness.

### Constraints

- **Limited Time for Implementation**  
  Due to limited time, only core features (like tracking completed habits and achievement system) were prioritized. More advanced features, such as personalized progress tracking, could not be implemented within the current project timeline.

- **User Customization**  
  Customizing habit categories or personalizing the look and feel of the app is an idea for future improvements. However, this would require extra development resources and time that were unavailable in the current scope.

## Challenges Faced

1. Learning Flutter and Dart

Since this was my first project using Flutter and Dart, there was a learning curve in understanding Flutter's widget tree, state management, and how Dart handles asynchronous operations. Adapting to Flutter‚Äôs declarative UI approach took some time but was a rewarding experience.

2. Creating a Minimalist yet Fun UI

Striking a balance between a simple, clutter-free design and an engaging user experience was a challenge. I aimed to keep the interface minimal while incorporating animations and gamification elements to make habit tracking more enjoyable.
